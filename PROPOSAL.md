# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Solomon Binyaminov

# Intentions:

Full file editor using ncurses.

# Intended usage:

User will be able to open/save files, edit text, scroll, move through the file using arrow keys, cut/copy/paste, jump to a certain line, and find text. 
  
# Technical Details:

Core file functionality (saving and opening) will requiring working with files extensively, text editing will require working with / allocating memory, signals will be necessary for functions (copy, paste, cut, jump-x-lines, find-text), ncurses will also be used to make the terminal interactive which will require working with processes.
    
# Intended pacing:

by 1/8: core ncurses 
by 1/9: moving through terminal and editing text
by 1/12: all file work. core program done (moving, editing, saving, and opening)
by 1/14: easy functions. cut/copy/paste
by 1/15: extra functions if time. jumping + finding.
